# how-to-control-led-matrix-using-arduino-uno.
this project is based on arduino uno,simply hardware and software.
we required a max72XX matrix,arduino uno and jumpers.
connection for hardware:
clk=10
cs=11
din=12
vcc=vcc
gnd=gnd
to draw what you want you need pixel to matrix application from here(http://educ8s.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LCDemoMatrix.zip)
after drawing pixel generate it and copy the genertaed code and paste it in the program.
upload the program and see the pixel you generated.ðŸ˜Š
